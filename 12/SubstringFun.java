// Review Exercise 4 from the previous chapter. It describes the substring() method of class String

// String newString = originalString.substring( int beginIndex, int endIndex )
// This method creates a new String object based on the original object, but containing only the characters that start at beginIndex and end at endIndex-1. It creates a completely new object by selectively copying characters from the original string.

// Write a program that asks the user for a string, a beginning index, and an ending index and then writes out the original string and the new substring:

// Enter a string:
// Eva, can I stab bats in a cave?
// Enter beginning index: 5
// Enter ending index: 20

// Original string:
// Eva, can I stab bats in a cave?

// Substring:
// can I stab bats
// Use Scanner.nextLine() to read in the user's string.
