// Exercise 1 â€” Discount Prices
// During a sale at a store, a 10% discount is applied to purchases over $10.00.
// Write a program that asks for the amount of a purchase, 
//then calculates the discounted price. The purchase amount will be input in cents (as an integer):

// Enter amount of purchases:
// 2000
// Discounted price: 1800
// Use integer arithmetic throughout the program.

// Click here to go back to the main menu.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class DiscountPrices{

    public static void main(String[] agrs){
        System.out.println("What is the total price of your purchase");

        //price = scanner.nextint();
        
        if(price < 10.00){

        }; 
      
    }
