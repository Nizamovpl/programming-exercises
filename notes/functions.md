Function: naming a process

reuse functions; cuts down code by finding patterns and using those code patterns

abstraction: lower level of details
concrete: high level of details
functions are abstractions

Java method(function):
methods exist within a class & are synonyms for functions

you can have imputs and outputs

2 types; 
- commands: functions without outputs
- queries: outputs

method signature
                                                                    //type _____
public(private,protected) static(or none) returntype(int,string,etc) methodName(paramaters,imputs){
        //internal code
        //internal code
}

private: only files with the same class can write code
protected: ________________________

main is static
not called from main would not be static

return type can be void

method names can be the same; it'll just see which parameters are available

overloading is using the same method names; useful

methodName(3) 3 = argument
paramater is the variable 

public ...... methodName(int x){
    //code
}
